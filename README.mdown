ASTeroids
=========

A simple Asteroids clone, inspired by [Square Shooter by No Time To Play][1], but written in Common Lisp with Lispbuilder-SDL.

Why?
----

I'm learning Common Lisp this year, and it seemed like a fun project. It was.

Why are the first three letters of ASTeroids capitalized?
---------------------------------------------------------

It's a pun on Abstract Syntax Tree - which Lisp essentially is. Sorry.
